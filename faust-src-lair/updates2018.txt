ap8x2.dsp implements freeverb, direct but no combs
it mixes its stereo inputs to mono before AP chain

new version, hand edited, keeps stereo channels separate
compiled with faust online compiler
just copied the compute routine directly into
ap8x2.dsp.h
(and changed new "inputs" & "outputs" to old "input" & "output")

kept old versions with ...mixInToMono
